# Intelligent Magic Cube üöÄ

A variety of intelligent search algorithms visually restore the 3D Magic Cube.

![](./preview.png)

This program is implemented by `tkinter` in combination with the third-party library [`tkintertools`](https://github.com/Xiaokang2022/tkintertools). `tkintertools` is a third-party library developed by me, I hope you will support me a lot!

## How to use

### Before use

Make sure your Python version is **3.12** or greater.

### Install dependency

Install the third-party library tkintertools:

```sh
pip install tkintertools==2.6.21.1
```

or

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### One last step

Run the `main.py`, and then, have fun!üòÅ

## Brief introduction

### List of algorithms

|      BFS      |     DFS     |     UCS      |    A/A*    |      HC       |             REV             |
| :-----------: | :---------: | :----------: | :--------: | :-----------: | :-------------------------: |
| Breadth First | Depth First | Uniform Cost | A / A Star | Hill Climbing | Not Algo, reverse operation |

### Evaluation functions

|   CBSV    |  ECLD  |    MHT    |   HM    |   MKVSK   |            h*             |
| :-------: | :----: | :-------: | :-----: | :-------: | :-----------------------: |
| Chebyshev | Euclid | Manhattan | Hamming | Minkowski | Ideal evaluation function |

### Customized actions

|   L   |   R   |   U   |   D   |   F   |   B   |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Left  | Right |  Up   | Down  | Front | Back  |

### Some operations

* Hold down the left mouse button and drag to rotate the Rubik's Cube;
* Hold down the right mouse button and drag to move the Rubik's Cube;
* Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the Rubik's Cube;
